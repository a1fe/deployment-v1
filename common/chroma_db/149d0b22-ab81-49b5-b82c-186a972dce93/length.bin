cauchy: Cauchy distribution, also known as the Breit-Wigner distribution.

Notes
-----

The probability density function for `rel_breitwigner` is

.. math::

    f(x, \rho) = \frac{k}{(x^2 - \rho^2)^2 + \rho^2}

where

.. math::
    k = \frac{2\sqrt{2}\rho^2\sqrt{\rho^2 + 1}}
        {\pi\sqrt{\rho^2 + \rho\sqrt{\rho^2 + 1}}}

The relativistic Breit-Wigner distribution is used in high energy physics
to model resonances [1]_. It gives the uncertainty in the invariant mass,
:math:`M` [2]_, of a resonance with characteristic mass :math:`M_0` and
decay-width :math:`\Gamma`, where :math:`M`, :math:`M_0` and :math:`\Gamma`
are expressed in natural units. In SciPy's parametrization, the shape
parameter :math:`\rho` is equal to :math:`M_0/\Gamma` and takes values in
:math:`(0, \infty)`.

Equivalently, the relativistic Breit-Wigner distribution is said to give
the uncertainty in the center-of-mass energy :math:`E_{\text{cm}}`. In
natural units, the speed of light :math:`c` is equal to 1 and the invariant
mass :math:`M` is equal to the rest energy :math:`Mc^2`. In the
center-of-mass frame, the rest energy is equal to the total energy [3]_.

%(after_notes)s

:math:`\rho = M/\Gamma` and :math:`\Gamma` is the scale parameter. For
example, if one seeks to model the :math:`Z^0` boson with :math:`M_0
\approx 91.1876 \text{ GeV}` and :math:`\Gamma \approx 2.4952\text{ GeV}`
[4]_ one can set ``rho=91.1876/2.4952`` and ``scale=2.4952``.

To ensure a physically meaningful result when using the `fit` method, one
should set ``floc=0`` to fix the location parameter to 0.
